# Instalocker

Simple python UI application that allows the user to instantly lock in their character (called an agent) in the game Valorant. It works by letting the user select an agent via a dropdown menu, then when the game loads into a new match, it will automatically select that agent for them.

## Requirements

You need to have python installed, watch a youtube video for this if you don't know how.

## Installation

Download the project as a .zip file, then extract to a folder

```bash
cd folder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the script

```bash
python main.py
```
- After running, the script will create a UI, which is pretty self explanatory. A dropdown to select the agent to lock in as, and a button that allows the user to toggle the instalocker on and off.
